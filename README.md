Fable is a free, open-source gacha bot â€” a great alternative to bots like Mudae,
Sofi, Karuta. Like those bots, you can pull anime characters, customize, and
upgrade them.

Unlike those bots, Fable is NOT a cash-grab scam, everything in Fable is free,
no players can pay to get ahead.

Fable comes with a system where anyone can create new characters, or add
characters that are missing from Fable. Then publish them for anyone else using
Fable to install, wanna start creating your own pack? Visit
<https://packs.fable.ing>

### FAQ

<details><summary>How can I limit Fable to 1 channel?</summary>
<p>

Go to **Server Settings** then **Integrations** then **Fable**\
From there you can control the permissions globally or even per command.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Can I use prefixes like $ or @Fable?</summary>
<p>

**No**. Fable was built from the ground up to only support slash commands,
prefixes are an entirely different thing that requires the bot to manually
monitor all incoming messages in a server. We won't add prefixes to Fable, but
you can go tell discord to add custom prefixes to "slash" commands instead of
"/" for all bots.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How can I install a new pack on my server?</summary>
<p>

Check the most popular packs or create your own pack at
<https://packs.fable.ing>

> `Manage Server` permission is required to install packs on "your" server

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How can I create a new pack?</summary>
<p>

It's very easy to create and update community packs, No coding required. Go to
<https://packs.fable.ing>

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How to uninstall a pack from my server?</summary>
<p>

Use `/packs uninstall id: pack-id`.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>How are you keeping Fable free?</summary>
<p>

We use serverless since it's cheaper and easier to maintain. Fable been getting
bigger and bigger recently and it's hard for me to keep paying the bill out of
my own pocket.

If you love Fable and want to keep it running forever, consider donating just a
single dollar, it will help a lot.
